## Technologies

Project is created with:
* clang++ 13.0.0

## Description

The aim of this project is to learn C++ from our C background from 42.\
Here is a not-limited list of topics covered the following modules:
* filestreams
* usage of class
* constructors/destructors
* private/protected/public keywords
* coplien form for classes
* virtual methods
* inherited classes
* references
* "new" and "delete" system calls
* methods overload
* operators overload
* abstract classes and interfaces
* different casts in c++ (static, dynamic, const)
* STL with useful containers (vector, stack, list, queue, string...)
* good habits while writing c++ code
* and many more !

## Installation

Just pull the project !

## Usage

Classic 42 Makefile:
````sh
make		#compiles everything and create woody_woodpacker binary
make clean	#removes all the .o files
make fclean	#removes all the .o files and the "woody_woodpacker" binary
make re		#cleans everything in the project and compiles everything again
````

## Utility

Very interesting overall, cpp became my favorite language of all because of its object-oriented vision.\
I also like the fact that it still is low-level, which is not very commun for a language as used as c++.
